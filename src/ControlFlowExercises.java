//---------------------------Do While Loop------------------------------
//Create a do-while loop that will count by 2's starting with 0 and ending at 100. Follow each number with a new line.
//               int i = 0;
//           do {

//Alter your loop to count backwards by 5's from 100 to -10.

//Create a do-while loop that starts at 2, and displays the number squared on each line while the number is
// less than 1,000,000. Output should equal:


//---------------------------For Loop------------------------------
//Refactor the previous two exercises to use a for loop instead



//---------------------------Fizz Buzz------------------------------
// One of the most common interview questions for entry-level programmers is the FizzBuzz test.
// Developed by Imran Ghory, the test is designed to assess basic looping and conditional logic skills.

    //Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
    //For multiples of three: print “Fizz” instead of the number.
    //For the multiples of five: print “Buzz”.
    //For numbers which are multiples of both three and five: print “FizzBuzz”.

//---------------------------Table of Powers------------------------------
    //Prompt the user to enter an integer.
    //Display a table of squares and cubes from 1 to the value entered.
    //Ask if the user wants to continue.
    //Assume that the user will enter valid data.
    //Only continue if the user agrees to.

//---------------------------Convert given number grades into letter grades------------------------------
    //Prompt the user for a numerical grade from 0 to 100.
    //Display the corresponding letter grade.
    //Prompt the user to continue.
    //Assume that the user will enter valid integers for the grades.
    //The application should only continue if the user agrees to.
           }
    }
